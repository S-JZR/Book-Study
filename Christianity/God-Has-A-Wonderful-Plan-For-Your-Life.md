# 1 Phenomenal Growth

> Jesus warned, “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven… Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness.’”

# 2 The Way Out of Problems?

> Instead of preaching the Good News that sinners can be made righteous in Christ and escape the wrath to come, we have settled for a “gospel” that implies that God’s primary purpose in saving us is to unfold a “wonderful plan” for our lives: to solve our problems, make us happy in Christ, and rescue us from the hassles of this life.

> If non-Christians respond to the gospel message only to improve their lives, they will be disillusioned when persecution comes, and they may fall away from the faith.

> The gospel message recorded in Scripture transcends time, place, and circumstances. It is the same message for all mankind throughout history.

# 3 The Happiness Dilemma

> ... if they do not repent of their sin (because they haven’t been told to), they will have a false conversion (see Mark 4:16,17) ... Though they may call Jesus “Lord,” they will continue to “practice lawlessness” (see Matthew 7:23). Consequently, they will bring their sins and their problems into the local church ...

> Jesus came to preach the Good News of God’s forgiveness to those who recognize their spiritual poverty and are broken by the realization that they have sinned against a just and holy God.

> Paul taught that the Christian life is one of self-denial—that we are to crucify the flesh, daily take up the cross, deny ourselves, and follow Jesus. However, the “wonderful plan” message, with its promise of earthly happiness, appeals solely to the hearer’s selfishness. By offering a problem-free life, it encourages continued love of self rather than God, and paints Him as a divine butler.

# 4 The Lost Key

> A man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ ...

> ... the Law’s ... purpose: bringing people to the knowledge of their sinfulness and their need for repentance and salvation.

> God will judge not only the actions but the thoughts and intents of the heart.

> ... once you understand that you have broken the law, then the good news that your penalty has been paid will become good news ...

> Many ... have wanted to avoid making sinners feel guilty. Yet the reality is that they are “guilty before God.”

# 6 The Motive and the Result

> ... we have “joy and peace in believing” (Romans 15:13) because we know that the righteousness of Christ is going to deliver us from the wrath to come.

> Sometimes there is confusion between “follow-up” (meaning “we need to follow the new converts around because they will ‘fall away’ if we don’t”) and discipleship (meaning “teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you,” Matthew 28:20).

> ... you cannot follow-up on a spiritually dead person. Being dead, he has no interest in growth.

# 7 What Did Jesus Do?

> At first glance it might seem worthwhile to ask what Jesus would do in a particular circumstance, but the question has an inherent flaw: it opens the door to speculation. The answer becomes open-ended so that people can make up whatever “Jesus” they want to fit anything they would like to do ... The better question to ask is, “What did Jesus do?” This confines our answers to the safe and reliable boundaries of the Bible.

> If the person is proud or self-righteous, he needs the Law to humble him.

> Without a thorough conviction of sin, men may seem to come to Jesus and follow Him for a season, but they will soon fall away and return to the world.

# 8 Raiders of the Contents of the Lost Ark

> ... when the Ten Commandments were removed from the schools of the United States, it left a generation in the dark as to moral absolutes.

> ... what one generation permits the next embraces as normality.

> ... this is not a “God-forsaken” world—it is a world that has forsaken God.

> I also never believe anyone when they tell me they are saved. It is my duty to challenge them and search out the solidness of their salvation.

> The size of our churches mean nothing if they prove to be full of false converts.

# Appendix: For My Campus Crusade Friends

> ... man tends to create his own standards of goodness; therefore he needs to see himself in light of God’s holy standard. All who violate God’s Law rightly incur His anger and wrath and will suffer the terrible consequences on Judgment Day.

> Because God is holy, He cannot ... allow sin in His presence … Because He is also just, He cannot let sin go unpunished.
