# Part I - Sun–tzu: The Thirteen-Chapter Text

## 1 On Assessments

> Warfare is the art (tao) of deceit. Therefore, when able, seem to be unable; when ready, seem unready; when nearby, seem far away; and when far away, seem near.

## 3 Planning the Attack

> ... the highest excellence is to subdue the enemy’s army without fighting at all.

## 5 Strategic Advantage (Shih)

> Generally in battle use the “straightforward” to engage the enemy and the “surprise” to win the victory.

## 6 Weak Points and Strong Points

> ... if we want to fight ... we strike at what he must rescue. If we do not want to fight ... we divert him to a different objective.

> To be prepared everywhere is to be weak everywhere.

> ... analyze the enemy’s battle plan to understand its merits and its weaknesses; provoke him to find out the pattern of his movements; make him show himself (hsing) to discover the viability of his battle position; skirmish with him to find out where he is strong and where he is vulnerable.

> ... one’s victories in battle cannot be repeated—they take their form (hsing) in response to inexhaustibly changing circumstances.

> ... avoid the enemy’s strong points and strike where he is weak.

## 7 Armed Contest

> ... unless you know the intentions of the rulers of the neighboring states, you cannot enter into preparatory alliances with them ...

## 8 Adapting to the Nine Contingencies (Pien)

> Do not depend on the enemy not coming; depend rather on being ready for him.

> There are five traits that are dangerous in a commander: If he has a reckless disregard for life, he can be killed; if he is determined to live at all costs, he can be captured; if he has a volatile temper, he can be provoked; if he is a man of uncompromising honor, he is open to insult; if he loves his people, he can be easily troubled and upset.

## 10 The Terrain

> ... if the way (tao) of battle guarantees you victory, it is right for you to insist on fighting even if the ruler has said not to; where the way (tao) of battle does not allow victory, it is right for you to refuse to fight even if the ruler has said you must.

> Know the other, know yourself, And the victory will not be at risk; Know the ground, know the natural conditions, And the victory can be total.

## 12 Incendiary Attack

> To be victorious in battle and win the spoils, and yet fail to exploit your achievement, is disastrous.

> The farsighted ruler thinks the situation through carefully;

> If there is no advantage, do not move into action;

## 13 Using Spies

> ... the reason the farsighted ruler and his superior commander conquer the enemy at every move, and achieve successes far beyond the reach of the common crowd, is foreknowledge.
